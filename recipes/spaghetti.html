  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Spaghetti is a beloved Italian pasta dish featuring long, thin noodles tossed in a savory tomato-based sauce. The sauce is often made with ripe tomatoes, garlic, onions, and a blend of aromatic herbs like basil and oregano, simmered to bring out a rich and tangy flavor. Ground meat, such as beef or sausage, can be added for a heartier meal, or the sauce can be kept simple and vegetarian. The spaghetti noodles are cooked until tender, then mixed with the sauce, allowing the flavors to meld together. Topped with a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of olive oil, spaghetti makes for a comforting, satisfying meal.</p>
