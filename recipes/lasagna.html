  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers wide, flat pasta noodles with a rich and flavorful combination of ground meat, tomatoes, and creamy b√©chamel or ricotta cheese. The hearty meat sauce, typically made with ground beef or sausage, is slow-cooked with onions, garlic, and herbs such as basil and oregano to develop depth of flavor. The pasta sheets are then alternated with generous portions of this meat sauce, cheese, and sometimes spinach or other vegetables, creating a comforting and satisfying meal. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked until the top layer of cheese becomes golden and bubbly, resulting in a dish that's perfect for sharing.</p>
