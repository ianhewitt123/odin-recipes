  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Rice is a versatile and widely consumed grain, serving as the foundation for countless dishes across various cuisines. Whether itâ€™s served as a side dish or used as a base for stir-fries, curries, or stews, rice is a simple yet satisfying staple. Cooked by boiling or steaming, it absorbs flavors well and can be seasoned or paired with an array of spices, herbs, and sauces. White or brown rice is most commonly used, though there are many varieties, each offering unique textures and tastes, from fluffy jasmine rice to hearty basmati or nutty wild rice.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Water</li> 
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Butter or olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Rinse the Rice:</strong>Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch, which helps the rice cook evenly and prevents it from being too sticky.</li>
    <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong>In a medium-sized pot, bring the water to a boil. Use a 2:1 ratio of water to rice for white rice or a 2.5:1 ratio for brown rice.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Rice and Simmer:</strong>Once the water reaches a boil, add the rice, salt (if using), and butter or olive oil (if desired).Stir once to ensure the rice is evenly distributed, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid..</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong>For white rice: Let it simmer on low heat for about 15-18 minutes, until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.For brown rice: Simmer for 35-40 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the water is absorbed..</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Rice Rest:</strong>Once cooked, remove the pot from heat and let the rice sit, covered, for 5-10 minutes. This step allows the steam to finish cooking the rice and helps the grains separate for a fluffier texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Fluff and Serve:</strong>After resting, fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains. Serve as a side dish or use it as a base for your favorite dishes.</li>
